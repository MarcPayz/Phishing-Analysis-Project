## General Knowledge
Before we begin I will give a litle background on Sublime Text, Wannabrowser, DomainTools, URL2PNG and VirusTotal
<br>

Sublime is a text editor which I will be using for identifying and retrieving email artifacts.

Wannabrowser is a tool that allows you to simulate any browser, similar to using a virtual machine but specifically for browsers. It enables you to inspect where shortened URLs, such as malicious Bitly links, lead without actually clicking on them. Wannabrowser can show you the number of redirects a URL goes through and provide other insights into the behavior and final destination of the URL. This can be particularly useful for cybersecurity professionals who need to analyze suspicious links safely.
<br>

DomainTools allows me to perform reverse DNS lookups to see who owns a specific domain.
<br>

URL2PNG allows you to view an image of the webpage that a URL leads to, so you can see what the site looks like without actually visiting it.
<br>

VirusTotal is a free online service that analyzes files and URLs to identify malware and other security threats. It aggregates multiple antivirus engines and various scanning tools to provide users with comprehensive insights into the safety of files and websites.
